        <h3>FAST</h3>
        <p>Unlike shared hosting, in VPS you will not share your sources with anyone else. Also, you get more ram and a much better CPU so that, your server can handle many requests at the same time without affecting performance.</p>

    <div class="wv-secure">
      <div class="topic">
        <h3>SECURE</h3>
        <p>In shared hosting, you and another bunch of people use the same IP address. If the server or any other website of them get attacked it directly affects every other website. Otherhand in VPS hosting you gate dedicated IP address for every server.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="lottie"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="wv-stable">
      <div class="topic">
        <h3>STABLE</h3>
        <p>As server use by yourself, meaning that no other activities directly affected your server. Also, Linux installed servers can run for years even without restarting. And it makes VPS servers more stable.</p>

      <div class="lottie"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="wv-scalable">
      <div class="topic">
        <h3>SCALABLE</h3>
        <p>When your website grows up, you needed more resources to handle that customer flow. If you are in shared hosting there is no way to upgrade, except server ‘down’. Thankfully in VPS, you can add more RAM, storage, and CPUs as you want without changing servers.</p>
